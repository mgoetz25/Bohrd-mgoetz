Midterm project submission for a Mobile Programming course.

Android-based application where user plays a Simon/Einstein type memorization game. They are given a grid of 9 squares and must replicate a sequence that increases by 1 step each time a level is completed. The sequence flashing gets gradually quicker with each level (up to 50).
Users who score highly can record their names for the hi-score record screen, which is accessible via the main menu and stored using key-value pairs.
There is an options screen as well for configuring volume, theme of the grid in-game, and whether they wish to see the banner when quitting advertising FSU's CS program.
